![Project Logo](link-to-your-logo-or-banner) <!-- Optional logo or image -->

## 📖 Description

This project is a **document forgery detection system** developed for the [Hackathon Name]. The goal is to use deep learning to detect forged documents based on image analysis.

Our model analyzes images of documents, classifies them as **genuine** or **forged**, and returns the confidence level of the prediction. It's a powerful tool to combat document fraud in industries like **healthcare**, **insurance**, and **legal sectors**.
