# üöÄ Fraud Snap: Document Forgery Detection

![Project Logo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZVZWMoGNTbqFFtjZzaJHTISlfTKGy9ji/view?usp=sharing) 

## üìñ Description

This project is a **document forgery detection system** developed for the [Hackathon Name]. The goal is to use deep learning to detect forged documents based on image analysis.

Our model analyzes images of documents, classifies them as **genuine** or **forged**, and returns the confidence level of the prediction. It's a powerful tool to combat document fraud in industries like **healthcare**, **insurance**, and **legal sectors**.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of images of genuine and forged documents, specifically designed for document forgery detection. It includes:

- **Genuine Documents**: Real documents in different formats.
- **Forged Documents**: Manipulated versions of genuine documents created with various editing tools.

The dataset can be accessed via the following sources:

- **Doctor Bills Dataset**: [Download Here](https://madm.dfki.de/downloads-ds-doctor-bills)
- **Doctor Bills Dataset**: [Download Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11Kg6vjd4CbqwguFgpfClK6E_0_DqjJas?usp=sharing) (Drive link)
- NOTE: The 2nd link is a drive link with images categorized into forged and genuine accordingly

Dataset distribution:

| Type      | Genuine | Forged |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| Type 01a  | 30      | 9      |
| Type 01b  | 20      | 0      |
| Type 02   | 40      | 12     |

Ensure that the dataset is pre-processed correctly (resize, normalization, etc.) before feeding it into the model.

## ‚≠ê Features

- üîç **Real-time document forgery detection** using a trained deep learning model.
- üìÑ **Batch processing** of multiple document images at once.
- üìä **Confidence scoring** for each prediction.
- üåê **Web-based interface** built with Streamlit for easy interaction.
- üì• **Downloadable reports** summarizing results in CSV format.

## üõ† Installation

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.7+**
- **pip** 
- **Git** 

### Setting Up

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/veydantkatyal/fraud-snap.git
   cd fraud-snap
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. **Install Depedencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the Streamlit App**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
The app will be hosted locally, and you can access it by visiting [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) in your browser.

 ## üåê Exposing the App to the Web with pyngrok

You can use **pyngrok** to expose your local Streamlit app to the web for others to access remotely. Here‚Äôs how to set up **ngrok authtoken** and use it with your app.

### 1. Install pyngrok
   pip install pyngrok

### 2. Get Your ngrok Authtoken 

1. Sign up for a free ngrok account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com).
2. Once signed in, go to the **Dashboard**.
3. Copy your **authtoken** from the dashboard under the "Auth" section.

### 3. Set the ngrok Authtoken

To authenticate ngrok with your authtoken, run the following command (replace `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` with the actual authtoken you copied):
ngrok authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN> This step only needs to be done once per environment.

### 4. Expose Your Streamlit App

Once your authtoken is set, you can run the following Python code to expose your Streamlit app:
from pyngrok import ngrok

!streamlit run app.py &

public_url = ngrok.connect(8501)
print(f"Streamlit app is running publicly at: {public_url}")


## üöÄ Usage

- **Upload Document Images**: Click on the "Upload" button to select one or more document images (JPG, PNG, TIFF).
- **Process the Images**: The app will analyze each document and display whether it's genuine or forged.
- **Download Report**: After processing, you can download the prediction report as a CSV file.
- **Batch Processing**: You can upload multiple documents simultaneously for bulk forgery detection.

## üíª Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Interactive web app framework for data science.
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework for model training and inference.
- **torchvision**: Image transformations and pre-trained models.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and CSV handling.
- **Pillow**: Image processing in Python.
- **pyngrok**: Expose the local app to the web (for development).

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Existing Limitations with the Model

Despite the promising performance, the current model has some limitations:

1. **Class Imbalance**: The dataset has a limited number of forged documents compared to genuine documents, which can lead to the model being biased towards predicting genuine documents. This can affect the accuracy of the forgery detection, especially for more complex forgeries.
   
2. **Document Variety**: The model has been trained on a specific dataset of documents (e.g., doctor bills). As such, it may not generalize well to other types of documents such as contracts, IDs, or certificates without further training.
   
3. **Limited Forgery Detection Techniques**: The current model focuses on visual forgery detection. It does not incorporate advanced methods like text analysis or metadata for forgery detection.
   
4. **Image Quality Sensitivity**: The model is sensitive to image quality and may fail to detect forgery if the image resolution is too low or if there are other noise artifacts.

## üöÄ Future Improvements

We plan to implement the following improvements to address the limitations and enhance the model‚Äôs effectiveness:

1. **Class Balancing and Data Augmentation**: To mitigate the class imbalance issue, we plan to incorporate techniques like **oversampling** or **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). Additionally, we will apply **data augmentation** (rotation, zooming, flipping) to create more varied examples of forged documents.

2. **Diverse Document Types**: The model will be retrained with a broader dataset, including various types of documents (e.g., passports, contracts, certificates) to improve generalization across different domains.

3. **Text-based and Metadata Analysis**: Adding **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)** capabilities to extract and analyze the text from the documents would enable the detection of content-based forgeries. Incorporating metadata checks (such as timestamps) could help uncover more subtle types of fraud.

4. **Transfer Learning with Advanced Architectures**: Experimenting with more advanced architectures such as **Vision Transformers (ViT)** or **EfficientNet** could enhance the model‚Äôs ability to detect fine-grained details in forged documents.

5. **Cloud Deployment**: Deploy the application on cloud platforms like **AWS** or **Google Cloud** to improve scalability and allow real-time forgery detection services in production environments.
